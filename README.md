Hello, fellow bladers! I'm a self-taught developer who recently (less than a month) got into the world of Beyblade X. One day, out of curiosity (and boredom), I decided to build a web app that lets you mix and match different parts to create your own custom Beyblades.

This is my personal take on a Beyblade X Builder, made just for fun and to learn more about coding and the Beyblade hobby. If you're into Beyblade X or just want to try building your own combo, feel free to check it out!

here's the link to the builder
